# Select-Components

The idea for this Project was to create a simple select component to add to my library.



#thought process

My first thought was to create a typescript interface to define the types of variables I'm going to use.

Next, I decided to create a CSS Modules file so I could reuse class names such as "container." 

I then proceded to create all of the small thing I would need for a select box component such as a clear button/caret symbol and a value box.

I created a static array of objects to represent future uses for my select component.

#styling

I realize how my select components select box needs to scale off of the font size used in future applications. So I used EM for the size of the select box, and the reasoning is EM scales off of font size.
